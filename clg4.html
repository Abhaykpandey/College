<p><h2>1.Infrastructure</h2></p>
The first thing on your evaluation list should be infrastructure – a critical point that you should note and compare. It is common that a student mostly gets lured by a great campus and extraordinary architecture if any. Instead of choosing the building that looks best, you need to choose the college that offers you all the basic set-up that is required to study the stream of your choice. For example, if you are looking into the top mechanical engineering colleges, check the classrooms, labs and practical rooms facilities, note the administrative wing specific to the department and also for soft-skills developmental workshops.

<p><h2>2.College hostel</h2></p>
It is important to note that the college you are choosing offers you a facility to stay in the college hostel. The hostel, in turn, must offer scopes like hygienic washrooms, clean and tidy rooms, good food, recreational space, and playground for outdoor games along with strict vigilance. Other necessities like round-the-clock internet connection, a mini library, a rich common room, and proper security must also be present. A peaceful staying environment will naturally reflect its impact on your college performance.

<p><h2>3.Library and information center</h2></p>
Libraries and information centers are the heart and soul of every educational institution. A rich library is a primary facility in every college as this feature will decide how far your research goes and to what depths you learn while studying your engineering of applied sciences. Before taking admission, take note that of the library facilities and check whether it has an option to borrow a wide variety of books you may require for your study, working internet connection and computers that might help you in completing assignments, and educational seminars periodically. 

<p><h2>4.College Cafeteria</h2></p>
Cafeterias are placed where discussions happen and ideas are exchanged. These are places that help students thrive, apart from providing the options of snacking or regular lunch. Thus, when you are selecting from the best MCA colleges in Greater Noida, do have a look into the college’s cafeteria as that is where you will be spending most your leisure time. Health and hygiene should be top-class, the sitting arrangement must be spacious. Food quality must be decent and cleanliness should be premier.

<p><h2>5.Extra-curricular activities</h2></p>
Sports, cultural events, clubs and other activities, all these combine to form the extra-curricular facilities that your college must provide along with their regular curriculum. Indulgence in side-activities has a known impact on educational performance. The more you participate in fine arts forms or sports, the better your life becomes in your college. So, while many do not pay heed to the extra-curricular infrastructure present in a college, it is primary that you check for these and select the one with at least the basic amenities.

<p><h2>6.Training and placement</h2></p>
Campus placement is a necessary feature of any of the top engineering colleges. But the training around it constitutes the facilities that you can expect from such colleges. This roughly means personality development workshops, interview training sessions, information about job-related topics and a feel about the market. A vigilant training and placement cell is a must-have facility within your college. It goes without saying, this is ultimately the facility that will help to get your career started and provide you with the required aids as a fresh graduate.
